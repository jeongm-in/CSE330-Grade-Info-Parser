# CSE330-Grade-Info-Parser
http://jeongm.in/~jeongmin/toolbox/regextract/ (site under maintenance)
The student repository name of this course containes many prefixes, while all I need for grading is `student ID`. 
Copy all the assigned repository names into the textbox, and this website will extract only `student ID` from the textbox. 
Graders are not assigned that many repositories, but I wrote this site because I felt the task became repetitive.
